It's awesome!

Testing
-------
Make sure all the requirements (**rspec** etc.) are met before continuing:
    bundle install

You can run all the tests manually at any time:
    bundle exec rspec spec/

You can also test continuously using **autotest**.

Install the **autotest** gem:
    gem install autotest

Start testing:
    autotest

*Note: You may want to dedicate another terminal to autotest*
