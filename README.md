It's awesome!

Testing
-------
Make sure all the requirements (rspec etc.) are met before continuing:
`bundle install`

Run all the tests manually:
`bundle exec rspec spec/`

You can also test continuously using autotest.
Install the gem:
`gem install autotest`
Start testing:
`autotest`
*Note: You may want to dedicate another terminal to autotest*
